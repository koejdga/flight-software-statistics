data retrieval
1. semantic scholar -- done
2. google scholar -- 429, but i have something
3. by years -- done

visualization
1. works nice
2. years -- not done at all

text representation
1. i guess doesn't work, i don't know


one might want to run 01_data_retrieval periodically, to get new results
at the same time running 02_data_retrieval_by_years is worth it once because the amount of papers from previous years is expected to be constant and not to change

i want to get data by years from 2000 to 2025
data: the same as in general but without pairings

20 requests for one year

graph with sims
25*20=500

can i use actual range structure from python intead of years_range tuple?


[
    "PX4",
    "ArduPilot",
    "BetaFlight",
    "INAV"
]

[
  "Gazebo",
  "Flightmare",
  "AirSim",
  "Isaac Sim",
  "Microsoft AirSim",
  "NVIDIA Isaac Sim"
]

print statement that there are years 2020, 2022-2024 (example)
compare google scholar and semantic scholar results
maybe add fields "format": "total" | "years"


years bar chart for separate things
for sim with and without uav word
graphs by years with all sims or all soft together
by years for one sim with google and with semantic





use scraper function
in years script

I need total from semantic scholar I guess
I can add up stuff from the file by years maybe
